			What looks like a watermelon is part cucumber and part melon. Here is an image of a rather large cucamelon in someone's hand for scale.

		<h2>A <em>little</em> background:</h2>
		<p>I have come across some pretty amazing produce. What can I say, for someone who lingers around Farmers Markets, is a community garden member, and likes to try new food, I have seen a lot of interesting produce in my life. The durian? Jackfruit? Even the beloved Cherimoya have all crossed my palette, so imagine my delight when I came across a tiny little piece of produce from our urban farm called a "Cucamelon."</p>
		<p>This page is dedicated to simple findings I've made on this newest of foods. My hope is that you get inspired and try to find one to eat too. <a href="#footnote">*</a></p>

		<h2>What is a Cucamelon?</h2>
		<p><em>Melothria scabra</em> as its species is known, is a fruit plant native to Central America. It's domestication as a crop may have happened before western documentation.</p>
		<p>Similar in coloring and shape to a seeded watermelon, the cucamelon is approximately 2cm in length at maturity. Much smaller than a watermelon, the cucamelon's interior is closer in resemblance to a cucumber.</p>
		<p>Flavor notes are also in the range of what an English or Persian cucumber tastes like, albeit with some tang reminiscent of a citrus fruit. Read on to see why I think this is so coolâ€¦</p>

	<article id="why"> 
		<h2>Why the interest in the Cucamelon?</h2>
		<p>Coming from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melothria_scabra">Wikipedia</a>, here is a list of all of the nicknames for this tiny fruit:</p>
		<ul class="nicknames">
			<li>mouse melon</li>
			<li>Mexican sour gherkin</li>
			<li>cucamelon</li>
			<li>Mexican miniature watermelon</li>
			<li>Mexican sour cucumber</li>
			<li>pepquinos</li>
		</ul>
		<p>How could one not like a fruit with such nicknames? With all of the seriousness rituals people have with their food, it is refreshing to have discovered something so whimsical at its root. Akin to the duckbill platypus, the cucamelon has recognizable elements of many familiar types produce. It is then in the eye or palette of the consumer to embrace the elements of choice.</p>

		<h2>What about the flavor?</h2>
		<p>I tried my first cucamelon straight after a garden harvest. Any relation to a watermelon is true in appearance, but amazingly off on flavor.</p>
		<p>Similar to a kumquat, the cucamelon has a root flavor of a cucumber, but with a much more bright and tart taste.</p>
		<p>Do you peel the cucamelon? No, that is the secondary fun part, you pop the whole thing in your mouth. Imagine the fun of swapping grapes or grape tomatoes for cucamelons in salads, or garnishing a fancy cocktail with the world's tiniest watermelon. There is a new world to explore in cucamelons.</p>

		<h2>Where does this leave us?</h2>
		<p>Well, hopefully the next time you go to your favorite produce shop, or make it to your local farmers market, you can inquire about the cucamelon. You need not a basketful, but rather a single taste, and I bet you will be hooked on the cutest little fruit out there.</p>
